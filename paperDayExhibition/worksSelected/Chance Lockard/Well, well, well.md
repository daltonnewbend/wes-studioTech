This print depicts the summer camp where I made a lot of my dearest friends and memories. To me, the way that paper receives not only ink but also the impression of the etching plate--and 'remembers' its shape, depth, and presence, even when dry--makes it the perfect substrate for a piece that hopes to evoke warmth and nostalgia.
