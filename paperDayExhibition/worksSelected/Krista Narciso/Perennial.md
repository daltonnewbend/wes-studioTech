Perennial is an artist book about memory, place, and labor, printed entirely on handmade paper. Making paper is physically demanding, time intensive process. For this book, hundreded of sheets of were made in a repetive process, that becomes a meditation despite its physical demands. I work with transparency in paper as a way of seeing into the past and future within the book form, while being in the present (spread.)
