Bromoil is an alternative analog photographic process invented in 1907 that was used primarily by European Pictorialist photographers from 1907 to the 1930s. The process involves creating a conventional gelatin silver print in the darkroom using specialized fibre-based paper, then bleaching the silver out of the print. Once bleached, the paper is soaked to swell the hardened gelatin on the surface which is then inked using lithographic ink. This inked matrix can be used as a base to make transfer prints or as the finalized artwork itself.
