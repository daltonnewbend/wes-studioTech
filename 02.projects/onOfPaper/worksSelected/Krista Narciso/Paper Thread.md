Paper Thread is a book entirely made of Japanese-style paper and shifu, or paper thread. The fiber that this book is made from is kozo, or paper mulberry —  specifically Iowa kozo, which was grown, tended, harvested, and processed at Oakdale research facility at the University of Iowa Center for the Book. I made this book when I was a graduate student there, as a love letter to the kozo trees. The thread was spun from the same handmade paper that the cover and pages are made from. The image embroidered on the front is the seed of the kozo tree and the interior image is the branch and leaves.
