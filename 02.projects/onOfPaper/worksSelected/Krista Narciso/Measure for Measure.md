Measure for Measure is an installation of 4,487 paper seeds, or samara, modeled after that of the common hop tree. The wings of the paper samara are made from abaca and the seed core is pigmented cotton. Paper is used to mimic the physical qualities of the seeds but also as a vehicle for movement, weight and weightlessness, and miles traveled.
