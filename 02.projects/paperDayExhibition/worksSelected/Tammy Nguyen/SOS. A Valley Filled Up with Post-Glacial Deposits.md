Paper is the foundation of all my work: my paintings, my artist books, and this work on paper.  Only on paper can I fit thousands of ideas onto a singular plane.  If I listen to it and engage with the way it wants to react to moisture and marks, it seems that it will let me be as broad or as tedious as I want.  I think that paper is a live organism capable of extraordinary transformation.
