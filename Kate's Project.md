What other objects would be on the ground
Where's waldo of find the artifacts
Objects are on the floor with Wangunk above
Have something more bright, even if not 'authentic'
bright color as background or objects?
smallest were a little small

kate handing over artistic decisions about color choices

maybe matisse style cutouts albers' colors, kara walker cutouts

more complex shapes to add foil for the round bulbous rocks
add leaves, maples, oaks
native insects, tiger beetle?, centipede
snakes
mouse

I'm gonna present making a scene that hides artifact that hang in somewhere for people search for

research, play with color
touch base monday and order paper
cut enough for one class by thursday (10 sheets of cutouts)
