Position Summary from HR Job Description with Additional Info 

Corn Center for the Visual Arts Senior Studio Technician is primarily responsible for a variety of tasks dealing with [[safety]](/safety.md) and [[maintenance]](/labs.md) of and access to classrooms, teaching studios, exhibition spaces, and safe and healthy operation of all tools, machinery, and equipment contained therein. Secondary responsibilities include overseeing the [[maintenance]](/labs.md) and upkeep of the Corn Center, Yancey One Arsenal, and Seaboard Depot, communicating with the Department of Art Chair, the administrative assistant, and faculty regarding maintenance of building spaces and their uses, and seeing to it that the buildings are appropriately set-up for lectures and other events. 

The Senior Studio Technician supervises three key roles, the [[Part-time (PT) Woodshop Technician]](/woodshop-tech.md), the [[PT Studio Technician]](/pt-studio-tech.md), and several Federal Work Study (FWS) Student Assistants called [[FWS Studio Monitors]](/fws-studio-monitors.md). The Senior Tech is also a key resource for alumni [[lab volunteers]](/lab-volunteers.md) and [[student interns]](/interns.md) who are performing facility-related tasks. 

To keep organized with the various employees you supervise, a SharePoint site was created called [[Art Department – Facility Operations]](/sharepoint.md). Commonly called “the SharePoint,” this site contains many documents pertaining to your role and the roles of those who report to you. Here you will find the [[eQuest]](/equest.md) tracking form, schedules, tasks, job descriptions, tool logs, safety data sheets, and more. It is owned by the Department Chair, the Administrative Support Assistant, the Coordinator of the Dean's Office, and most chiefly, the Senior Studio Technician. This site should be shared with all the PT Studio Techs, FWS Monitors, and may be beneficial to share with Alumni Volunteers and other departmental Student Assistants. 

We will be discussing technician work at large for the facility, rather than focusing on just the Senior Studio Tech, as all these responsibilities fall to them in the event a part-time tech is unavailable.
