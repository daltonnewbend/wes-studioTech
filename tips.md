## The things you wish someone told you 

This role is a full-time, benefits eligible, non-exempt role (FTBE). This means you work forty (40) hours a week at a paid rate-per-hour. Benefits include paid time off (PTO), health insurance, tuition assistance program (TAP), and retirement plans. Non-exempt means you are not exempt from labor laws, thus you are guaranteed a break and must be compensated for additional labor outside of your job description or working over 40 hours a week.  

PTO is accrued each month at a rate of ten (10) vacation hours and eight (8) sick hours. You are also granted four (4) educational support hours every six months. Lastly, you also have paid holidays on designated federal holidays listed here. Please note that this does not include spring break or summer vacation. 

Health insurance is subject to change each year, so you must watch for the open enrollment period, which typically lasts one week in October. 

TAP is a program that allows employees of the University System of Georgia (USG) to take courses for free, so long as they have been a FTBE employee for at least six months.
